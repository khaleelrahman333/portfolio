    According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), the name Bartholomew has been steadily on the rise in the United States for the past 15 years.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The number of infants named Bartholomew has fluctuated in frequency in the U.S. over the past hundred years. The name reached its lowest points in 2009 and 2004, both years in which only seven infants were named Bartholomew.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Since this lowpoint, the frequency of the name has been on the rise up until 2023 in which 33 people were named Bartholomew. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The frequency of Bartholomew reached its zenith of the past century in 1969, in which 75 people were named Bartholomew. The two years that had the second highest frequency were 1971 and 1980, in which there were 71 babies named Bartholomew in both years. The name saw a continuous climb from the 1930s up until its peak in the late 60s.

    According to Oxford University Press’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9nd05X_awIgC&pg=PT81#v=onepage&q&f=false"> “Dictionary of First Names,”</a>
     the name Bartholomew originates from an Aramaic phrase meaning “son of Talmai.” Talmai is an originally Hebrew name which translates to “abounding in furrows.” Bartholomew is most well-known for being the name of  a disciple mentioned in New Testament.

    Using <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">real data</a>  from the Social Security Administration (SSA), I’ve documented the frequency of the name Bartholomew in the United States over the course of 100 years from 1923-2023. I went through the SSA dataset for each year in that timespan to find out how many babies were named Bartholomew. These datasets only account for individuals with a Social Security Number.
